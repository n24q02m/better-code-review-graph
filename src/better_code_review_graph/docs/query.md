# query Tool Documentation

Read-only queries against the knowledge graph — pattern queries, search, impact analysis, and code quality checks.

## Actions

### query
Run predefined graph queries to explore code relationships.

**Parameters:**
- `pattern` (required): Query pattern. One of:
  - `callers_of`: Find functions that call the target
  - `callees_of`: Find functions called by the target
  - `imports_of`: Find what the target imports
  - `importers_of`: Find files that import the target
  - `children_of`: Find nodes contained in a file or class
  - `tests_for`: Find tests for the target
  - `inheritors_of`: Find classes inheriting from the target
  - `file_summary`: Get all nodes in a file
- `target` (required): Node name, qualified name, or file path
- `repo_root`: Repository root path (auto-detected)
- `repo`: Federated repo filter (Phase 2). When non-empty, restricts results to nodes whose `repo_id` matches. Default `""` queries every registered repo (legacy behaviour). Useful to disambiguate same-named symbols across federated repos. Discover available `repo_id`s by inspecting the `repos` table in the graph DB after a federated `graph(action="build", roots=[...])`; see `graph.md` "Federation: cross-repo graphs" for the derivation rule.

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "query", "pattern": "callers_of", "target": "authenticate"}
{"action": "query", "pattern": "file_summary", "target": "src/auth.py"}
{"action": "query", "pattern": "tests_for", "target": "UserService"}
{"action": "query", "pattern": "callers_of", "target": "authenticate", "repo": "repo_a-3f2a91bc"}
```

Multi-word search uses AND-logic: `"firebase auth"` matches nodes containing both words.
Common JS/TS builtins (map, filter, forEach, etc.) are filtered from `callers_of` results to reduce noise.

### search
Search for code entities by name, keyword, or semantic similarity.

**Parameters:**
- `search_query` (required): Search string
- `kind`: Filter by node type: File, Class, Function, Type, or Test
- `limit`: Maximum results (default: 20)
- `repo_root`: Repository root path (auto-detected)
- `repo`: Federated repo filter (Phase 2). When non-empty, restricts results to nodes whose `repo_id` matches. Default `""` searches across every registered repo. Vector hits are cross-checked against the SQL `repo_id` column so semantic-mode results are filtered consistently with keyword-mode. See `graph.md` "Federation: cross-repo graphs" for `repo_id` discovery.

Uses vector embeddings for semantic search when available (run `graph action=embed` first). Falls back to keyword matching otherwise.

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "search", "search_query": "authentication", "kind": "Function"}
{"action": "search", "search_query": "database connection", "limit": 10}
```

### impact
Analyze the blast radius of changed files. Shows which functions, classes, and files are impacted by changes.

**Parameters:**
- `changed_files`: List of changed file paths (auto-detected from git)
- `max_depth`: Hops to traverse in dependency graph (default: 2)
- `max_results`: Maximum impacted nodes to return (default: 500)
- `base`: Git ref for auto-detecting changes (default: HEAD~1)
- `repo_root`: Repository root path (auto-detected)
- `repo`: Federated repo filter (Phase 2). When non-empty, scopes the BFS to nodes whose `repo_id` matches. Default `""` traverses across every federated repo, so cross-repo `IMPORTS_FROM` edges count toward the blast radius. See `graph.md` "Federation: cross-repo graphs" for `repo_id` discovery.

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "impact", "changed_files": ["src/auth.py", "src/models.py"]}
{"action": "impact", "max_depth": 3, "base": "main"}
{"action": "impact", "changed_files": ["src/auth.py"], "repo": "repo_a-3f2a91bc"}
```

---

### large_functions
Find functions, classes, or files exceeding a line-count threshold. Useful for decomposition audits and code quality checks.

**Parameters:**
- `min_lines`: Minimum line count to flag (default: 50)
- `kind`: Filter: Function, Class, File, or Test
- `file_path_pattern`: Filter by file path substring (e.g. "components/")
- `limit`: Maximum results (default: 50)
- `repo_root`: Repository root path (auto-detected)
- `repo`: Federated repo filter (Phase 2). When non-empty, restricts oversized-node results to nodes whose `repo_id` matches. Default `""` returns large nodes across every federated repo. See `graph.md` "Federation: cross-repo graphs" for `repo_id` discovery.

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "large_functions", "min_lines": 100, "kind": "Function"}
{"action": "large_functions", "file_path_pattern": "src/", "limit": 20}
{"action": "large_functions", "min_lines": 100, "repo": "repo_a-3f2a91bc"}
```

## Temporal queries (Phase 3 v2.0+)

Every `query` / `search` / `impact` action accepts an optional
`as_of: str = ""` cross-cutting param for snapshot semantics. Default
(`""`) returns currently-valid rows only -- the SQL filter is
`WHERE valid_to_sha IS NULL`. The temporal columns are populated by
the v2 ingest path (alembic revision `005_temporal_columns`), which
auto-applies on first `GraphStore` open and seeds `valid_from_sha`
from `git rev-parse HEAD`.

### `as_of`

When set, returns rows that were valid at the given commit SHA. MVP
scope: matches rows where `valid_from_sha == as_of` OR
`valid_to_sha == as_of`. Useful for "show me what `authenticate`
looked like three commits ago" style queries.

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "query", "pattern": "callers_of",
 "target": "src/auth.py::authenticate",
 "as_of": "abc12345"}
```

```json
{"action": "search", "search_query": "authenticate",
 "as_of": "abc12345"}
```

### `diff` action

`query(action="diff", from_sha=X, to_sha=Y)` returns three buckets
identifying nodes that changed between two commit SHAs. The diff is
computed entirely from the temporal columns -- the parser does NOT
re-run.

| Bucket | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `added` | Introduced at `to_sha` (no prior row with same `qualified_name`). |
| `removed` | Closed at `to_sha` with no replacement. |
| `modified` | Superseded at `to_sha` -- one row closed AND a new row opened (function body changed). |

**Parameters:**
- `from_sha` (required): Earlier commit SHA.
- `to_sha` (required): Later commit SHA.
- `repo`: Optional `repo_id` filter.
- `repo_root`: Repository root path (auto-detected).

**Example:**
```json
{"action": "diff", "from_sha": "abc12345", "to_sha": "def67890"}
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "from_sha": "abc12345",
  "to_sha": "def67890",
  "added": [
    {"id": 17, "qualified_name": "src/auth.py::login_v2", "kind": "Function"}
  ],
  "removed": [
    {"id": 4, "qualified_name": "src/auth.py::login_legacy", "kind": "Function"}
  ],
  "modified": [
    {"qualified_name": "src/auth.py::authenticate"}
  ]
}
```

### Recipe -- audit a refactor commit

```json
{"tool": "query", "action": "diff",
 "from_sha": "abc12345", "to_sha": "def67890"}
```

Pair with `review(action="delta", show_line_shifts=true, ...)` (see
`review.md`) when you want callsite-line shifts on top of the
add/remove/modify buckets.
