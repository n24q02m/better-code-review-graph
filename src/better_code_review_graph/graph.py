# tracking).  Any upgrade chain that crosses *into* this revision

# ``<db>.pre-2.0.bak`` before alembic runs.

# so lexical comparison matches numeric comparison.  When the day
# comes that the project switches to alembic's default 12-char hex
# ids (or a downstream fork inherits this hook), this constant +

        Mirrors ``_ensure_federation_columns`` for the
        ``005_temporal_columns`` migration. Two cases land here:

        * In-memory ``:memory:`` databases — alembic creates the schema
          in a separate in-memory connection (per the
          ``sqlite:///:memory:`` URL semantics), so the migration never
          touches ``self._conn``. The legacy ``_SCHEMA_SQL`` is frozen
          at v1.6 and intentionally does not include the temporal
          columns, so we add them here to keep the v2 query layer
          (``valid_to_sha IS NULL`` filters) working without forcing
          every test to use a file-backed DB.
        * File-backed databases that bypassed alembic for any reason —
          the ``IF NOT EXISTS`` guard on the index plus the
          column-presence check make this safe to call unconditionally
          on every connect.

        ``valid_from_sha`` defaults to a 40-zero sentinel so legacy
        rows inserted via ``upsert_node`` (which does NOT set the
        column) survive the NOT NULL constraint. The sentinel matches
        the in-memory fallback used by the alembic migration so
        downstream temporal queries treat the two paths identically.
