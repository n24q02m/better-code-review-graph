## 2024-05-26 - Replace fetchall() with direct cursor iteration

**Learning:** Using `.fetchall()` on SQLite cursors materializes large intermediate lists in memory. This is particularly problematic for queries that return many rows or rows with large text columns, leading to significant peak memory overhead.

**Action:** Globally replace `rows = cursor.fetchall()` and `for row in rows` with direct iteration over the cursor object `for row in cursor` to process results as they are yielded, significantly reducing peak memory consumption. When iterating directly, `fetchone()` is used to peek at the result where necessary, keeping in mind that it advances the cursor.
