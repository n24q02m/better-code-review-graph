"""Alembic environment for better-code-review-graph.

The SQLAlchemy URL is supplied at runtime by ``GraphStore._init_schema()``
(via ``Config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", ...)``) so the same env.py
is used for both production upgrades and pytest fixtures. We therefore do
not read a URL from ``alembic.ini`` — the ini value is intentionally empty.

Autogenerate is not used: migrations in this project are hand-authored
because the schema is owned by ``graph.py:_SCHEMA_SQL`` (the legacy
bootstrap kept as a smoke comparator) and we want the migration files to
be auditable line-for-line against that constant.
