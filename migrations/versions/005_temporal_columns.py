"""Temporal columns: BREAKING add valid_from_sha / valid_to_sha (Phase 3 Task 6).

Revision ``005`` is the v2.0.0 BREAKING migration that introduces
SHA-anchored temporal tracking on every graph row. The new columns let
the v2 query layer answer "what did the graph look like at commit X?"
without re-running the parser by intersecting ``valid_from_sha`` (the
commit the row first appeared at) with ``valid_to_sha`` (the commit that
superseded it; ``NULL`` means the row is still current).

Schema additions (both ``nodes`` and ``edges``):

* ``valid_from_sha`` (TEXT, NOT NULL, ``server_default = <repo-HEAD-SHA-at-migration-time>``)
  — backfills every pre-existing row with the current repo HEAD so the
  temporal lineage starts cleanly. New ``INSERT`` statements that omit
  this column inherit the same DDL default; the v2 ingest path is
  expected to set the column explicitly per-commit so the default only
  matters for forensic / migration-day rows.
* ``valid_to_sha`` (TEXT, NULL allowed, no default) — ``NULL`` is the
  semantic sentinel for "currently valid". The v2 supersede path will
  ``UPDATE ... SET valid_to_sha = <new-commit>`` rather than deleting
  rows, preserving history.
* ``idx_nodes_temporal`` on ``nodes(valid_from_sha, valid_to_sha)`` and
  ``idx_edges_temporal`` on ``edges(valid_from_sha, valid_to_sha)`` —
  the canonical scan pattern for "as-of <sha>" lookups.

BREAKING — why
--------------
Previous additive migrations (003 federation, 004 security_tags) used
``server_default = ''`` or ``NULL`` so existing rows backfilled
trivially. ``valid_from_sha NOT NULL`` cannot use an empty default
(querying ``WHERE valid_from_sha = ''`` would mean "rows from no
commit" — semantically undefined). We therefore have to read the actual
repo HEAD at migration time and bake it into the DDL default. That step
requires a working git repo on disk; if absent, the migration aborts
with an actionable :class:`RuntimeError` (the operator can either point
the DB at a repo or set ``CRG_DOWNGRADE_TO_1_X=1`` to restore the
pre-2.0 backup taken by the Phase 3 Task 1 hook).

Repo discovery
--------------
The migration extracts the SQLite file path from the alembic
``sqlalchemy.url`` and walks up its parent chain looking for a
``.git`` entry (file or directory — supports submodules / worktrees).
The walk-up matches ``crg``'s storage convention of placing
``graph.db`` at ``<repo>/.code-review-graph/graph.db`` but does not
hard-code the depth: any ancestor with ``.git`` qualifies.

SQLite limitations
------------------
SQLite < 3.35 cannot ``ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`` natively. The
downgrade path therefore wraps each table in ``op.batch_alter_table``
which performs the create-new-table-copy-drop-old-rename dance under
the hood. Indexes are dropped first (in the same direction the upgrade
created them) so the downgrade does not leave orphaned index entries
referring to dropped columns.

# Recognized SQLite URL shapes that ``GraphStore`` and the test helpers
# build via ``Config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", ...)``. The
# SQLAlchemy convention is always exactly 3 slashes after ``sqlite:``:
#
# * ``sqlite:///C:/path/g.db`` — Windows absolute (path = ``C:/path/g.db``)
# * ``sqlite:////tmp/g.db`` — POSIX absolute (path = ``/tmp/g.db``; the
#   4th slash is the leading slash of the absolute path, NOT part of
#   the prefix)
# * ``sqlite:///rel/path/g.db`` — relative (path = ``rel/path/g.db``)
#
# A previous version of this regex used ``{2,4}`` for the slash count,
# which is greedy and silently swallowed the leading ``/`` on POSIX
# absolute URLs (turning ``sqlite:////tmp/g.db`` into the relative
# path ``tmp/g.db``). On Linux/macOS CI runners that resolved against
# the pytest CWD (= project workspace), so the walk-up in
# :func:`_find_repo_root` ended at the project's ``.git`` instead of
# the test fixture's tmp_path ``.git``. Pinning to exactly 3 slashes
# preserves the leading slash on POSIX absolute paths.

# Sentinel SHA used when the migration cannot read a real HEAD:
# 40 zeros is git's empty-tree marker and stable across hosts. The
# migration uses this sentinel for two distinct cases:

# 1. ``:memory:`` URLs — those DBs do not survive the process so the
#    SHA we bake into the DDL default is only the value for transient
#    test rows. There is nothing to back-fill on disk.
#
# 2. ``CRG_TEST_ALLOW_NO_GIT=1`` is set in the environment AND no
#    ``.git`` ancestor is reachable from the DB path. This is the
#    test-suite escape hatch: pytest creates throwaway DBs in
#    ``tmp_path`` / ``tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`` paths that live
#    outside any git repo, and several legacy tests deliberately
#    probe behaviour that assumes those tmp dirs are NOT inside a
#    git repo. Without the escape hatch every test would have to
#    git-init its own tmp dir, which conflicts with tests that
#    construct ``tmp_path / ".git"`` themselves.
#
# Production code paths leave ``CRG_TEST_ALLOW_NO_GIT`` unset, so the
# migration still aborts with the actionable :class:`RuntimeError`
# whenever a file-backed DB has no reachable repo — production data
