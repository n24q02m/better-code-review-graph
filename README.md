</a>

An MCP server that parses your codebase with [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), builds a structural graph of functions/classes/imports, and gives Claude (or any MCP client) precise context so it reads only what matters instead of the whole tree. Semantic search runs on a local ONNX embedding model by default (zero config, no API key), with an optional cloud embedding chain. Fork of [code-review-graph](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph) with fixed multi-word search, qualified call resolution, dual-mode embeddings, output pagination, and production CI/CD.

## v2.0 migration (BREAKING)

v2.0 adds temporal columns (`valid_from_sha` / `valid_to_sha` on every node + edge) and an opt-in security scanner. The schema migration is auto-applied on first `GraphStore` open, and a backup of the pre-2.0 DB is saved to `<graph_db>.pre-2.0.bak` so you can roll back. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](BREAKING_CHANGES.md) for the full schema-change list, behavior changes, environment requirements, and the downgrade procedure (`CRG_DOWNGRADE_TO_1_X=1 uv run better-code-review-graph`).

## Install

The server runs over **stdio** by default and works with any MCP client. The
recommended launcher is [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (no install step --
it fetches and runs the published package in an isolated environment):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "better-code-review-graph": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.13", "better-code-review-graph"],
      "env": { "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio" }
    }
  }
}
```

Or install it as a Python package:

```bash
uvx better-code-review-graph        # run without installing
pip install better-code-review-graph
```

The optional Semgrep engine for deeper security scans is a separate extra:

```bash
pip install 'better-code-review-graph[security]'
```

**Install with an AI agent** -- paste this to your AI coding agent:

> Install MCP server `better-code-review-graph` following the steps at
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n24q02m/claude-plugins/main/plugins/better-code-review-graph/setup-with-agent.md

Full per-client setup (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, raw
`mcp.json`) is at
**[mcp.n24q02m.com/servers/better-code-review-graph/setup/](https://mcp.n24q02m.com/servers/better-code-review-graph/setup/)**.

## Smithery

The repo ships a [`smithery.yaml`](smithery.yaml) so the server can be built and
run through [Smithery](https://smithery.ai). It deploys over **stdio** and needs
no startup configuration -- the config schema is empty, and any optional cloud
embedding/summary keys are supplied at runtime through the server's own config
flow (see [Configuration](#configuration) below). The launch command is the same
`uvx` invocation as a local install:

```yaml
startCommand:
  type: stdio
  commandFunction: |-
    (config) => ({ command: 'uvx', args: ['--python', '3.13', 'better-code-review-graph'] })
```

## Configuration

Everything works **out of the box with zero configuration** -- semantic search
uses a local [qwen3-embed](https://github.com/n24q02m/qwen3-embed) ONNX model
(`Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`, ~570 MB downloaded on first `graph embed`). All
environment variables below are optional and only needed for cloud embeddings
or LLM summaries.

### Model chains

Embeddings and summaries are each driven by an **ordered model chain** -- a
CSV of `provider/model` entries where the order is the litellm fallback order
(first entry is the active model). The provider is inferred from the model
prefix, so the matching `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` is all you need to add.

| Variable | Purpose | Empty (default) |
|---|---|---|
| `EMBEDDING_MODELS` | Cloud embedding chain, e.g. `jina_ai/jina-embeddings-v5-text-small,gemini/gemini-embedding-001` | Local ONNX (qwen3-embed) |
| `SUMMARY_MODELS` | Summarizer chain for `graph(action="summarize")`, e.g. `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,openai/gpt-4o-mini` | Summaries disabled |

All vectors are stored at a fixed 768 dimensions (MRL truncation), so the
embeddings table schema stays valid across providers. Switching embedding
*model* changes the vector space; embeddings are tracked per provider and a
provider switch triggers re-embedding rather than mixing incomparable vectors.

### Provider API keys

Cloud models need the provider key for whatever prefixes appear in your chains.
Without any cloud key the server stays on local ONNX. Summarizers must expose a
chat-completion API (so Jina and Cohere are embedding-only).

| Model prefix | API key env var | Get a key |
|---|---|---|
| `jina_ai/` | `JINA_AI_API_KEY` | <https://jina.ai/api-key> |
| `gemini/` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) | <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey> |
| `openai/` (or bare `text-embedding-*`) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys> |
| `cohere/` | `COHERE_API_KEY` | <https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys> |
| `vertex_express/` | `GOOGLE_VERTEX_EXPRESS_API_KEY` | <https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview> |

Any other [litellm provider](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) works via
its standard `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`.

### Advanced

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `EMBEDDING_API_BASE` | Custom OpenAI-compatible base URL for cloud embedding (SSRF-guarded) |
| `LLM_API_BASE` | Custom OpenAI-compatible base URL for the summarizer (SSRF-guarded) |
| `DISABLE_LOCAL_EMBED` | Skip the local ONNX download; embedding is unavailable unless a cloud chain is configured |
| `CRG_DATA_DIR` | Override the per-user data directory (default `~/.crg`) used for per-user graphs and credentials in HTTP multi-user mode |
| `EMBEDDING_BACKEND` / `EMBEDDING_MODEL` / `SUMMARY_MODEL` | **Deprecated** singular vars, honored one release with a warning -- migrate to the `*_MODELS` chains |

### Example -- cloud embeddings + summaries

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "better-code-review-graph": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.13", "better-code-review-graph"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "EMBEDDING_MODELS": "jina_ai/jina-embeddings-v5-text-small,gemini/gemini-embedding-001",
        "SUMMARY_MODELS": "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash",
        "JINA_AI_API_KEY": "jina_...",
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "AIza..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also configure cloud keys interactively in HTTP mode via the relay
setup form (`config(action="setup_start")` returns the browser URL). See the
[modes overview](https://mcp.n24q02m.com/get-started/modes-overview/) and
[multi-user setup](https://mcp.n24q02m.com/get-started/multi-user/).

### Workspace username (HTTP setup form)

The relay setup form has an optional **workspace username** field. Entering the
same username always lands you in the same per-`sub` bucket, so your keys and
graph stay reachable across a re-authorization and across devices, instead of
being tied to the one-off subject minted for each `/authorize` round-trip.
Leaving it blank keeps the previous per-authorize behaviour.

Trust boundary: when the form is gated by a *shared* `MCP_RELAY_PASSWORD`, the
username is a partition key, not a secret -- anyone who knows that password can
type any username and reach that bucket. That is fine for a trusted group; an
untrusted multi-tenant deployment needs a per-user secret or delegated OAuth
instead.

**One-time migration:** existing users must re-enter their credentials once after
this change. Nothing is deleted; credentials stored under the old random subject
are simply no longer addressed.

## Tools

Seven tools, each grouping related actions to keep the tool surface small.

### `graph` -- Graph lifecycle

Actions: `build` | `update` | `stats` | `embed` | `export` | `summarize`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `build` | Full or incremental graph build. Set `full_rebuild=true` to re-parse all files; pass `roots` to federate extra repo directories into one graph. |
| `update` | Alias for `build` with `full_rebuild=false` (incremental). |
| `stats` | Graph size, languages, node/edge breakdown, embedding count. |
| `embed` | Compute vector embeddings for semantic search. Dual-mode: local ONNX or cloud chain. |
| `export` | Export the graph as `graphml` / `json-ld` / `dot` / `cypher`. Inline or to `output_path`. |
| `summarize` | LLM-generated one-paragraph docstrings for `Function` nodes (via the `SUMMARY_MODELS` chain; no-op when no provider key is set). Cost-capped via `max_nodes`. |

### `query` -- Graph queries

Actions: `query` | `search` | `impact` | `large_functions` | `spot_check` | `renamed_in_diff` | `diff`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `query` | Predefined patterns: `callers_of`, `callees_of`, `imports_of`, `importers_of`, `children_of`, `tests_for`, `inheritors_of`, `file_summary`. |
| `search` | Search code entities by name/keyword or semantic similarity. |
| `impact` | Blast radius of changed files. Auto-detects from git diff. Paginated with `max_results`. |
| `large_functions` | Find functions/classes exceeding a line-count threshold. |
| `spot_check` | Random callsite snippets from the last `callers_of`/`callees_of`/`inheritors_of`/`importers_of` result. |
| `renamed_in_diff` | Symbols whose callsite line shifted versus a base ref. |
| `diff` | Nodes added/removed/modified between two commit SHAs (`from_sha`, `to_sha`). |

Most read actions accept `as_of=<sha>` for temporal (point-in-time) snapshots
and `repo=<repo_id>` to scope a federated multi-repo graph.

### `review` -- Code review context

Actions: `context` (default) | `delta`

Token-optimized review context with structural summary, impacted nodes, source
snippets, and review guidance. `context` auto-detects changed files from the
git diff; `delta` (with `from_sha`/`to_sha`, optional `show_line_shifts`)
surfaces refactor moves between two commits.

### `config` -- Server configuration and credential setup

Actions: `status` | `set` | `cache_clear` | `setup_status` | `setup_start` | `setup_skip` | `setup_reset` | `setup_complete`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `status` | Server info: version, graph path, node/edge counts, embedding backend, embeddings count. |
| `set` | Update a runtime setting (`key=log_level`). |
| `cache_clear` | Remove all computed embeddings. |
| `setup_status` | Show current credential state, providers configured, and setup URL. |
| `setup_start` | Start relay setup to configure API keys via browser (HTTP mode). |
| `setup_skip` | Set local mode (skip relay permanently, use ONNX only). |
| `setup_reset` | Clear credentials and reset state. |
| `setup_complete` | Re-resolve credentials from environment variables. |

### `security` -- Security scanning

Actions: `scan` | `report` | `suppress` | `rule_list`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `scan` | Run a security scan (`engine='heuristic'` default = 5 regex rules, or `'semgrep'`). Findings persist on `nodes.security_tags`. |
| `report` | Re-emit cached findings as JSON (`format='json'`) or SARIF v2.1.0 (`format='sarif'`). |
| `suppress` | Suppress a finding by `rule_id` (or `remove=true` to un-suppress). |
| `rule_list` | List available rules for an engine. |

The `semgrep` engine requires the `[security]` extra and runs Semgrep's
`p/auto` registry pack plus a 3-rule curated overlay.

### `help` -- Full documentation

Topics: `graph` | `query` | `review` | `config` | `security` | `recipes`

Returns complete documentation for each tool. Use when the compressed
descriptions above are insufficient.

### `config__open_relay` -- Re-trigger the relay setup form

Registered automatically from [mcp-core](https://github.com/n24q02m/mcp-core).
In HTTP mode it returns `<PUBLIC_URL>/authorize` so the agent can re-open the
browser setup form (e.g. after credential expiry); in stdio mode it returns
`status: 'stdio_unsupported'`.

## CLI

Running `better-code-review-graph` with **no arguments** starts the MCP server
over stdio (this is what an MCP client launches). A leading positional argument
routes to a subcommand instead -- handy for building or embedding the graph
directly from a shell or CI step, before any MCP client connects. Run these with
`uvx` (or `uv run` from a source checkout):

```bash
# Start the MCP server over stdio (default -- no subcommand)
uvx better-code-review-graph

# Build (or incrementally update) the graph for the current repo
uvx better-code-review-graph graph build

# Full re-parse of every file instead of a git-diff incremental
uvx better-code-review-graph graph build --full-rebuild

# Compute embeddings for semantic search (local ONNX by default)
uvx better-code-review-graph graph embed
```

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `graph build` | Full or incremental graph build. `--full-rebuild` re-parses every file; `--base <ref>` sets the git ref for the incremental diff (default `HEAD~1`); `--repo-root <path>` overrides the auto-detected repo root. |
| `graph embed` | Compute vector embeddings for the current graph (local ONNX or the configured cloud chain). Accepts `--repo-root`. |
| `config status` / `config delete` | Show or remove the stored credential config (`--yes` skips the delete confirmation). |
| `doctor` | Environment self-check: Python version, credential backend, store-dir writability, config and relay state. |
| `relay status` / `relay open` / `relay reset` | Inspect, open, or clear the browser relay setup session (HTTP mode). |

The `graph build` and `graph embed` subcommands print a JSON result and exit
non-zero on error. The `config`, `doctor`, and `relay` subcommands come from the
shared [mcp-core](https://github.com/n24q02m/mcp-core) CLI.

## Features

What this fork fixes versus the upstream [code-review-graph](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph):

Cells marked `?` are capabilities the competitor does not publicly document, not confirmed absences.

## Security

- **Graceful fallbacks** -- Cloud embedding failure falls back to local ONNX.
- **Error handling** -- Tools return error strings with fix suggestions, never crash.
- **Read-only mount** -- Docker mode mounts the repo as `:ro` (read-only).
- **SSRF-guarded endpoints** -- Custom `EMBEDDING_API_BASE` / `LLM_API_BASE` URLs are validated before any outbound call.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n24q02m/better-code-review-graph
cd better-code-review-graph
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
uv run better-code-review-graph
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.13, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Trust model

This plugin implements **TC-Local** (machine-bound, single trust principal). See the [mcp-core trust model](https://mcp.n24q02m.com/servers/mcp-core/trust-model/) for full classification.

| Mode | Graph DB | Cloud credentials | Who can read your data? |
|---|---|---|---|
| stdio (default) | `<repo>/.code-review-graph/graph.db` (git-ignored) | `~/.better-code-review-graph-mcp/config.json` (AES-GCM, machine-bound key) | Only your OS user |
| HTTP self-host (multi-user) | Per-user `~/.crg/subs/<sub>/graph.db` | Per-user `~/.crg/subs/<sub>/config.json` | Only the authenticated user |

## Migration & changelog

The v2.0 release added **temporal columns** (`valid_from_sha` / `valid_to_sha`
on every node and edge) plus an opt-in security scanner. The schema migration
is auto-applied on first `GraphStore` open, and a backup of the pre-2.0 DB is
written to `<graph_db>.pre-2.0.bak`. To downgrade and restore it:

```sh
CRG_DOWNGRADE_TO_1_X=1 uvx better-code-review-graph
```
