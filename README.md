# Better Code Review Graph

> **Renamed (2026-09-13):** repo is now `crg` — CLI-first (`crg` command). PyPI package stays `better-code-review-graph`; MCP server is a secondary surface.

mcp-name: io.github.n24q02m/crg

**Knowledge graph for token-efficient code reviews -- semantic search and call-graph resolution across your codebase.**

An MCP server that parses your codebase with [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), builds a structural graph of functions/classes/imports, and gives Claude (or any MCP client) precise context so it reads only what matters instead of the whole tree. Semantic search runs through the local ONNX model registry from [fastretrieval](https://github.com/n24q02m/fastretrieval) by default (zero config, no API key), with an optional cloud embedding chain. Fork of [code-review-graph](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph) with fixed multi-word search, qualified call resolution, dual-mode embeddings, output pagination, and production CI/CD.

## v2.0 migration (BREAKING)

v2.0 adds temporal columns (`valid_from_sha` / `valid_to_sha` on every node + edge) and an opt-in security scanner. The schema migration is auto-applied on first `GraphStore` open, and a backup of the pre-2.0 DB is saved to `<graph_db>.pre-2.0.bak` so you can roll back. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](BREAKING_CHANGES.md) for the full schema-change list, behavior changes, environment requirements, and the downgrade procedure (`CRG_DOWNGRADE_TO_1_X=1 uv run crg`).

## Install

For OMP and other local coding harnesses, the primary surface is the package CLI
plus the bundled `skills/` workflows. The skills invoke the CLI directly and do
not require an MCP server mapping.

```bash
# Run without a persistent install (short `crg` script; PyPI package name stays
# better-code-review-graph, so `uvx` needs the explicit --from form)
uvx --python 3.13 --from better-code-review-graph crg graph build --full-rebuild \
  --repo-root /path/to/repo
uvx --python 3.13 --from better-code-review-graph crg graph stats \
  --repo-root /path/to/repo

# Or install the console scripts (installs both `crg` and the legacy long name)
pip install better-code-review-graph
crg query search --search-query "authentication" \
  --repo-root /path/to/repo
```

The optional Semgrep engine for deeper security scans is a separate extra:

```bash
pip install 'better-code-review-graph[security]'
```

MCP stdio remains a secondary protocol adapter for clients that require it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crg": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.13", "better-code-review-graph"],
      "env": { "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio" }
    }
  }
}
```

Install matrix (stdio unless noted; the CLI-first usage above stays the primary surface):

| Client | Install |
|---|---|
| Claude Code (plugin) | `/plugin marketplace add n24q02m/claude-plugins` then `/plugin install better-code-review-graph@n24q02m-plugins` |
| Claude Code (stdio) | `claude mcp add crg -- uvx --python 3.13 better-code-review-graph` |
| Codex | register stdio command `uvx --python 3.13 better-code-review-graph` under `mcp_servers` in `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| Gemini CLI | add the `mcpServers` JSON above to `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| Cursor / Windsurf | add the `mcpServers` JSON above via the client's MCP settings (`mcp.json`) |
| Any client (HTTP self-host) | point the client at `https://<your-host>/mcp` (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http`) -- self-host only, no hosted endpoint |

**Install with an AI agent** -- paste this to your AI coding agent:

> Install MCP server `crg` following the steps at
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n24q02m/claude-plugins/main/plugins/better-code-review-graph/setup-with-agent.md

Full CLI usage is in [CLI](#cli). Optional per-client MCP setup is at
**[mcp.n24q02m.com/servers/better-code-review-graph/setup/](https://mcp.n24q02m.com/servers/better-code-review-graph/setup/)**.

## Usage

Two ways to run the server, plus the surfaces to consume it.

### Dev: uv, no auth (loopback only)

```bash
# instance config lives at $CRG_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.crg (same schema as hull's
# config.toml); a default no-auth template is fine for local dev
uv run better-code-review-graph server start
# -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp  (no-auth is refused on any off-loopback bind)
```

### Always-on: docker (token auth)

```bash
cp docker-config/config.example.toml docker-config/config.toml
# mint a token + hash (hull CLI ships with crg's dependency tree):
#   TOKEN=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))")
#   hull token hash "$TOKEN"   # paste output into token_hash in config.toml
docker compose up -d
```

The compose file builds the Dockerfile's `http` target (image `crg:http`),
publishes the container on host loopback only
(`127.0.0.1:${CRG_PORT:-8772}:8080`), and mounts
`./docker-config/config.toml` read-only at the container's config dir
(`CRG_CONFIG_DIR=/data/config`); graph state persists in the `crg-data`
named volume. All state stays on your machine.

### Consuming: CLI or MCP

CLI (local graphs, no server needed):

```bash
crg graph build --full-rebuild --repo-root /path/to/repo
crg query search --search-query "authentication" --repo-root /path/to/repo
```

MCP over HTTP (remote/always-on): point any MCP client at
`http://127.0.0.1:8772/mcp` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "better-code-review-graph": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8772/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Per-task model configuration

Each task (embed / rerank / chat / jev_score) resolves its own OpenAI-spec
provider cell from `[models.<task>]` in the instance config: an independent
`base_url` + `api_key` + `model`. Cloud or local is purely a config choice —
point `base_url` at OpenRouter, a vendor, or your own local gateway
(e.g. `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1`). API keys are host-only
material: keep them in `config.toml` (gitignored under `docker-config/`) or
supply via `HULL_<TASK>_API_KEY` env; they are never end-user supplied.

## Local-first boundary

CRG is local-first for coding workflows:

- **CLI and bundled Skills are the primary surfaces** for graph build/query,
  impact analysis, review context, security scans, and repository onboarding.
- **MCP stdio is the secondary protocol adapter** over the same local domain
  services; it does not maintain a separate graph implementation.
- Graph state stays in `<repo>/.crg/graph.db` unless an explicit
  multi-user/self-host configuration selects another data directory.
- PyPI, CI, security scanning, GitHub releases, and eligible stable MCP Registry
  publication remain active. Historical public OCI tags are retained, but new
  public Docker Hub/GHCR images are no longer published.
- CRG has no hosted Cloudflare runtime in the target topology.

## Smithery

The repo ships a [`smithery.yaml`](smithery.yaml) so the server can be built and
run through [Smithery](https://smithery.ai). It deploys over **stdio** and needs
no startup configuration -- the config schema is empty, and any optional cloud
embedding/summary keys are supplied at runtime through the server's own config
flow (see [Configuration](#configuration) below). The launch command is the same
`uvx` invocation as a local install:

```yaml
startCommand:
  type: stdio
  commandFunction: |-
    (config) => ({ command: 'uvx', args: ['--python', '3.13', 'crg'] })
```

## Configuration

Everything works **out of the box with zero configuration** -- semantic search
uses the local ONNX registry from [fastretrieval](https://github.com/n24q02m/fastretrieval)
(`Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` is the current built-in reference entry, ~570 MB
downloaded on first `graph embed`). This reference entry is not a Qwen-only
boundary: any built-in registry ID or valid non-Qwen artifact manifest follows
the same resolver. All environment variables below are optional and only needed
for cloud embeddings, LLM summaries, or an explicit BYO local artifact.

### Model selection

Embeddings select the first `provider/model` entry in `EMBEDDING_MODELS`; later
entries are retained as configuration but are not runtime fallbacks. Summaries
select the first `SUMMARY_MODELS` entry too, without runtime fallback. Transport
always comes from the per-task `[models.<task>]` cell (OpenRouter pre-wired
default) — model-name prefixes only select wire details, never keys.

| Variable | Purpose | Empty (default) |
|---|---|---|
| `EMBEDDING_MODELS` | Cloud embedding selection; the first entry is active | Local fastretrieval registry |
| `SUMMARY_MODELS` | Completion model selection for `graph(action="summarize")` | Summaries disabled |

Cohere `embed-v4.0` requests and stores **1024 dimensions**; other backends retain
768-dimensional storage. CRG never slices, pads, or silently accepts a different
provider width. The embedding row's model and byte width must match before reuse.
Run `graph(action="embed")` after changing models or upgrading an old 768-wide
Cohere index. Searches reject incompatible widths before a provider call; graph
nodes are retained and re-embedding replaces only stale vectors.

### Provider API keys

The key lives in the per-task cell's `api_key` (host-only; see the table below).
Keys alone never select models: an empty embedding chain stays local, and an empty summary
chain stays disabled. A configured cloud error does not fall back to local or
another provider. Summarizers require a chat-completion model.

| Task | Config cell | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Embedding | `[models.embed]` in the instance config (`base_url` + `api_key` + `model`), or `HULL_EMBED_API_KEY` env | Plain OpenAI-spec HTTP through hull-core; OpenRouter pre-wired default. `EMBEDDING_MODELS` picks the model name(s) — keys never select a model. Model prefixes (`cohere/…`, `jina_ai/…`, `gemini/…`) select wire details only (e.g. Cohere `input_type`); there are no per-vendor API keys. Cohere embed-4.0 direct is the documented opt-in exception (spec 2026-09-26 §9). |
| Summarizer | `[models.chat]` cell (or `HULL_CHAT_API_KEY`) | Requires a chat-completion model; OpenRouter default. |

Vendor-specific key env vars (`JINA_AI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_VERTEX_EXPRESS_API_KEY`, …) are **not read** by
crg; the removed per-vendor dispatch lived in the pre-de-host stack.

### Advanced

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `EMBEDDING_MODELS` | Comma-separated embedding model chain; the first entry is the cloud model (host-owned; keys never select a model). Legacy `EMBEDDING_MODEL` is honored with a deprecation warning until the next release. |
| `DISABLE_LOCAL_EMBED` | Skip the local ONNX download; embedding is unavailable unless a cloud chain is configured |
| `LOCAL_RERANK_MODEL` | Fastretrieval `TextCrossEncoder` model ID for bounded semantic reranking | Blank (disabled) |
| `LOCAL_EMBEDDING_DIM` | Required dimension for an external model ID without a manifest | `0` |
| `LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL_FILE` | ONNX file path inside a manifest-backed artifact directory | `onnx/model.onnx` |
| `LOCAL_EMBEDDING_POOLING` | Explicit pooling for an external ID without a manifest: `CLS`, `MEAN`, `LAST_TOKEN`, or `DISABLED` | `MEAN` |
| `LOCAL_EMBEDDING_NORMALIZE` | Explicit L2 normalization for an external ID without a manifest | `true` |
| `CRG_DATA_DIR` | Override the per-user data directory (default `~/.crg`) used for per-user graphs and credentials in HTTP multi-user mode |
| `EMBEDDING_BACKEND` / `EMBEDDING_MODEL` / `SUMMARY_MODEL` | **Deprecated** singular vars, honored one release with a warning -- migrate to the `*_MODELS` chains |

When `LOCAL_RERANK_MODEL` is configured, semantic vector search retrieves a
bounded candidate pool of `min(max(limit * 4, limit), 100)` rows, applies the
existing `kind`, `repo`, and live-row filters, then reranks that pool and returns
at most `limit` rows. The response uses `search_mode="semantic_reranked"` and
adds `rerank_score` while preserving `similarity_score`. Blank keeps the
existing `limit * 2` vector path and `search_mode="semantic"`. Configured
reranker failures return an explicit error; CRG does not silently fall back to
vector or keyword results. Keyword searches, including `as_of` snapshots, do
not invoke the reranker.

### Example -- cloud embeddings + summaries

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crg": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.13", "better-code-review-graph"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "EMBEDDING_MODELS": "cohere/embed-v4.0",
        "SUMMARY_MODELS": "openrouter/minimax/minimax-m3:free",
        "EMBEDDING_API_BASE": "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account>/<gateway>/cohere/v2/embed",
        "LLM_API_BASE": "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account>/<gateway>/openrouter/v1",
        "COHERE_API_KEY": "<cohere-key>",
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "<openrouter-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cohere embedding is paid. Authorize a bounded budget before a live index/query;
the Minimax-free completion choice does not make embeddings free. This example
does not add a process-wide model override: missing subject credentials fail
closed rather than inheriting the server environment.

CRG currently has **no cloud rerank call**: `LOCAL_RERANK_MODEL` is its only
reranking path. Setting `RERANK_MODELS` or `RERANK_API_BASE` does not enable one.

## Tools

Six tools, each grouping related actions to keep the tool surface small.

### `graph` -- Graph lifecycle

Actions: `build` | `update` | `stats` | `embed` | `export` | `summarize`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `build` | Full or incremental graph build. Set `full_rebuild=true` to re-parse all files; pass `roots` to federate extra repo directories into one graph. |
| `update` | Alias for `build` with `full_rebuild=false` (incremental). |
| `stats` | Graph size, languages, node/edge breakdown, embedding count. |
| `embed` | Compute vector embeddings for semantic search. Dual-mode: local ONNX or cloud chain. |
| `export` | Export the graph as `graphml` / `json-ld` / `dot` / `cypher`. Inline or to `output_path`. |
| `summarize` | LLM-generated one-paragraph docstrings for `Function` nodes (via the first explicit `SUMMARY_MODELS` entry; no-op when no model is selected). Calls bounded by `max_nodes`. |

### `query` -- Graph queries

Actions: `query` | `search` | `impact` | `large_functions` | `spot_check` | `renamed_in_diff` | `diff`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `query` | Predefined patterns: `callers_of`, `callees_of`, `imports_of`, `importers_of`, `children_of`, `tests_for`, `inheritors_of`, `file_summary`. |
| `search` | Search code entities by name/keyword or semantic similarity. |
| `impact` | Blast radius of changed files. Auto-detects from git diff. Paginated with `max_results`. |
| `large_functions` | Find functions/classes exceeding a line-count threshold. |
| `spot_check` | Random callsite snippets from the last `callers_of`/`callees_of`/`inheritors_of`/`importers_of` result. |
| `renamed_in_diff` | Symbols whose callsite line shifted versus a base ref. |
| `diff` | Nodes added/removed/modified between two commit SHAs (`from_sha`, `to_sha`). |

Most read actions accept `as_of=<sha>` for temporal (point-in-time) snapshots
and `repo=<repo_id>` to scope a federated multi-repo graph.

### `review` -- Code review context

Actions: `context` (default) | `delta`

Token-optimized review context with structural summary, impacted nodes, source
snippets, and review guidance. `context` auto-detects changed files from the
git diff; `delta` (with `from_sha`/`to_sha`, optional `show_line_shifts`)
surfaces refactor moves between two commits.

### `config` -- Server configuration and credential setup

Actions: `status` | `set` | `cache_clear` | `setup_status` | `setup_start` | `setup_skip` | `setup_reset` | `setup_complete`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `status` | Server info: version, graph path, node/edge counts, embedding backend, embeddings count. |
| `set` | Update a runtime setting (`key=log_level`). |
| `cache_clear` | Remove all computed embeddings. |
| `setup_status` | Show current credential state and which model cells have keys. |
| `setup_start` | Explain where the host configures API keys (host-owned model cells). |
| `setup_skip` | Set local mode (local ONNX embedding, no cloud cells). |
| `setup_reset` | Reset state to local; host config re-resolves on next call. |
| `setup_complete` | Re-resolve credential state from host config. |

### `security` -- Security scanning

Actions: `scan` | `report` | `suppress` | `rule_list`

| Action | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `scan` | Run a security scan (`engine='heuristic'` default = 5 regex rules, or `'semgrep'`). Findings persist on `nodes.security_tags`. |
| `report` | Re-emit cached findings as JSON (`format='json'`) or SARIF v2.1.0 (`format='sarif'`). |
| `suppress` | Suppress a finding by `rule_id` (or `remove=true` to un-suppress). |
| `rule_list` | List available rules for an engine. |

The `semgrep` engine requires the `[security]` extra and runs Semgrep's
`p/auto` registry pack plus a 3-rule curated overlay.

### `help` -- Full documentation

Topics: `graph` | `query` | `review` | `config` | `security` | `recipes`

Returns complete documentation for each tool. Use when the compressed
descriptions above are insufficient.

## CLI

The package installs two console scripts: **`crg`** (primary) and
`crg` (legacy long name). Running either with **no
arguments** starts the MCP server over stdio; a leading positional argument
routes to a local CLI subcommand that calls the same domain services used by
the MCP adapter. Run them directly after `pip install`, or without a
persistent install via `uvx --python 3.13 --from better-code-review-graph crg ...`.

```bash
# Start the MCP server over stdio (default -- no subcommand)
crg

# Build, inspect, and embed the local graph
crg graph build
crg graph stats
crg graph embed

# Query relationships and impact
crg query query \
  --pattern callers_of --target "path/to/module.py::function"
crg query search --search-query "authentication"
crg query impact --changed-files src/app.py

# Produce review context and run a local security scan
crg review context --base HEAD~1
crg security scan --engine heuristic
```

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `graph build` | Full or incremental graph build. `--full-rebuild` re-parses every file; `--base <ref>` sets the incremental diff ref; `--repo-root <path>` overrides auto-detection. |
| `graph embed` | Compute vector embeddings using local ONNX or the configured cloud chain. |
| `graph stats` / `graph export` / `graph import` / `graph summarize` | Inspect, export/import a portable `crg` graph, or summarize functions. |
| `query query` / `query search` | Run relationship patterns or keyword/semantic search. |
| `query impact` / `query large_functions` | Analyze changed-file blast radius or find oversized nodes. |
| `query spot_check` / `query renamed_in_diff` / `query diff` | Inspect callsites, line shifts, or commit-to-commit graph changes. |
| `review context` / `review delta` | Generate review context or diff buckets for a code change. |
| `security scan` / `security report` / `security suppress` / `security rule_list` | Run and manage heuristic/Semgrep security findings. |

CLI subcommands print structured JSON and exit non-zero on an error.

## Security

- **Explicit selection** -- Cloud embedding errors are reported; the runtime does not silently switch models or fall back to local ONNX.
- **Error handling** -- Tools return error strings with fix suggestions, never crash.
- **Read-only mount** -- Docker mode mounts the repo as `:ro` (read-only).
- **SSRF-guarded endpoints** -- Custom `EMBEDDING_API_BASE` / `LLM_API_BASE` URLs are validated before any outbound call.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n24q02m/crg
cd crg
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
uv run crg
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.13, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Trust model

This plugin implements **TC-Local** (machine-bound, single trust principal). See the [mcp-core trust model](https://mcp.n24q02m.com/servers/mcp-core/trust-model/) for full classification.

| Mode | Graph DB | Cloud credentials | Who can read your data? |
|---|---|---|---|
| stdio (default) | `<repo>/.crg/graph.db` (git-ignored) | `~/.crg/config.toml` (AES-GCM, machine-bound key) | Only your OS user |
| HTTP self-host (multi-user) | Per-user `~/.crg/subs/<sub>/graph.db` | Per-user `~/.crg/subs/<sub>/config.json` | Only the authenticated user |

## Migration & changelog

Graph, security scan cache, and suppression state now use the package-owned
`.crg/` directory. Run `graph(action="build", full_rebuild=true)`
once after upgrading, followed by `graph(action="embed")` if semantic search is
needed. The old `.better-code-review-graph/` state directory plus the ambiguous
`.code-review-graph/` and `.code-review-graph.db` paths and their SQLite
sidecars are left untouched, not migrated. Review and reapply any desired
suppression rules explicitly.

The v2.0 release added **temporal columns** (`valid_from_sha` / `valid_to_sha`
on every node and edge) plus an opt-in security scanner. The schema migration
is auto-applied on first `GraphStore` open, and a backup of the pre-2.0 DB is
written to `<graph_db>.pre-2.0.bak`. To downgrade and restore it:

```sh
CRG_DOWNGRADE_TO_1_X=1 uvx better-code-review-graph
```
