    Without this, tests that ``git init`` a throwaway repo and run
    ``git commit`` inherit the developer/CI ``commit.gpgsign``,
    ``gpg.format``, and ``user.signingkey`` from ``~/.gitconfig``.
    When the signing program is not actually wired up for the
    sandboxed test environment (e.g. inside a CI runner image that
    pre-configures SSH signing), the commit aborts with a confusing
    "signing failed" error unrelated to the test logic.

    We also strip the per-invocation ``GIT_*`` location vars that ``git``
    injects into hook processes (``GIT_DIR`` / ``GIT_INDEX_FILE`` /
    ``GIT_WORK_TREE`` / ``GIT_PREFIX`` / ``GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`` /
    ``GIT_COMMON_DIR``). Otherwise, when the suite runs as the ``pytest``
    pre-commit hook, those vars point every ``git`` subprocess in
    ``test_temporal_migration`` back at the parent repo's (locked) index
    instead of the tmp repo it just created -> ``git commit`` exits 1 and
    the tests error. Popping them makes the git-subprocess tests hermetic.

    The Phase 3 Task 6 BREAKING migration (``005_temporal_columns``)
    reads ``git rev-parse HEAD`` from the repo containing the graph DB
    so it can backfill ``valid_from_sha``. Production deployments
    always satisfy this invariant — CRG only indexes git repos. The
    test suite, however, creates throwaway DBs in ``tmp_path`` /
    ``tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`` paths that live outside any git
    repo, and many legacy tests deliberately probe code paths that
    assume those tmp dirs are NOT inside a git repo (see
    ``test_incremental.py::TestFindRepoRoot::test_returns_none_without_git``).

    Setting ``CRG_TEST_ALLOW_NO_GIT=1`` flips migration 005 to use the
    documented in-memory sentinel SHA (40 zeros) when no ``.git``
    ancestor is reachable. The migration still aborts with the
    actionable :class:`RuntimeError` in production code paths where
    the env var is unset. Tests that exercise the abort path

    MUST run before ``_isolate_per_plugin_home`` redirects HOME -- session
    scope guarantees that, since pytest sets higher-scoped fixtures up first.

    ``tree_sitter_language_pack`` keeps its downloaded grammar shared
    libraries in an OS cache dir derived from the environment (``$HOME`` /
    ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME`` on Linux, ``LOCALAPPDATA`` on Windows). Redirecting
    HOME per-test moves that cache to an empty tmp dir, so every
    ``get_parser`` call has to re-download the grammar; on a network-
    restricted CI runner that raises
    ``RuntimeError: Download error: Could not determine system cache
    directory``. ``CodeParser._get_parser`` catches that and returns
    ``None``, which ``parse_bytes`` turns into an empty result -- so the
    whole suite silently parses zero nodes instead of erroring. That is
    exactly what happened on ubuntu-latest, while Windows stayed green
    because its cache follows LOCALAPPDATA rather than the redirected home.

    Resolving the path here and handing it straight back via ``configure``
    is idempotent (verified: ``cache_dir()`` is unchanged afterwards) and
    keeps grammar loading working identically to a run with no fixtures at
    all. The grammar cache is a downloaded build artifact, not developer
    state, so sharing it is the same deliberate carve-out as
    ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`` above -- credential isolation is unaffected because
    ``PerPluginStore`` resolves from ``Path.home()``, not this cache.

    out of the developer's real home directory.

    ``mcp_core.storage.per_plugin_store.PerPluginStore`` resolves every path
    from ``Path.home()``: the encrypted config lands in
    ``~/.better-code-review-graph-mcp/config.json`` and the AES-GCM machine
    key in ``~/.better-code-review-graph-mcp/.secret``. Tests that exercise
    the ``config`` tool end-to-end (e.g.
    ``test_server.py::TestConfigTool::test_setup_status_action``) reach the
    real store unmocked, so on a machine where the developer actually uses
    CRG a plain ``uv run pytest`` reads their live credentials and
    ``_load_or_generate_machine_key`` mints a fresh ``.secret`` into their
    home. ``credential_state._sub_data_dir`` has the same problem via its
    ``~/.crg`` default. In CI with parallel workers those writes race on one
    shared home.

    ``Path.home()`` reads ``HOME`` on POSIX and ``USERPROFILE`` on Windows,
    so both are set. This is function-scoped on purpose: neither
    session-scoped autouse fixture above resolves a home path (they only set
    ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`` and ``CRG_TEST_ALLOW_NO_GIT``), so there is nothing
    that needs the redirect earlier than per-test setup, and function scope
